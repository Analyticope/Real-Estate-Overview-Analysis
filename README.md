  ### Data Cleaning/Preparation

 At the initial stage of this real estate project, I carried out essential data preparation and cleanup to ensure the property dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This process involved:
 
1.	Importing and reviewing property listings to understand the dataset’s structure and data quality.
  
2.	Addressing missing property details (such as prices, status, or location) to maintain data reliability.
  
3.	Filtering out empty records and irrelevant fields to focus only on valid listings.
  
4.	Standardizing key attributes like price formats, location names, and listing statuses for uniformity across all entries.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis

   EDA Questions for the California Real Estate Dashboard

1. What’s the average property price and price per square foot across listings?
  
2. How many properties are currently in the dataset?
  
3. Which homes fall under the most affordable and highest valuation ranges?
  
4. Does having a pool or spa increase property value?
  
5. Which home type  condo, townhouse, single-family, or multi-family — is the most expensive or affordable?
  
6. How are listings distributed by status (for sale, sold, removed, or price change)?
  
7. Which city has the highest number of listings or market activity?
  
8. How have property listings changed over time — are there any noticeable trends?
  
9. What cities or areas stand out as market hotspots?
  
10. What overall pricing and market patterns can be seen across different property types and locations?

•	Property Type Analysis: Multi-family homes recorded the highest average prices, followed by single-family units, townhouses, and condos as the most affordable.

•	Pool/Spa Impact: Properties with pool or spa features tend to attract higher prices compared to those without.

•	Geographical Insights: Cities like Alameda, Alhambra, and Anaheim showed the highest property listings and market activity.

•	Market Trends: Listing volumes peaked mid-year, showing active market engagement during that period.

  ### Recommendation

  From this real estate analysis, a few things stand out that can guide better decisions:
  
•	**Target top-performing cities**: Areas like Alameda, Alhambra, and Anaheim show strong activity and higher prices. These cities are great spots for investors or agents 
  looking for profitable opportunities.
  
•	**Promote value-boosting features**: Properties with pools or spas tend to sell at higher prices. Highlighting these features in listings can attract more serious buyers.

•	**Balance property options**: While multi-family and single-family homes bring in higher returns, condos and townhouses remain affordable choices for new buyers. Keeping 
    a mix of both helps reach a wider market.
•	**Leverage seasonal trends**: Since listings peak around mid-year, focusing marketing and sales campaigns during this time can increase visibility and sales success.

•	**Study removed listings**: Checking why some properties were taken off the market can help identify pricing or demand issues that need improvement.

     
### Conclusion
This real estate dashboard gives a clear view of California’s housing market. It shows that cities like Alameda, Alhambra, and Anaheim have strong activity and higher property values. Homes with pools or spas attract better prices, while condos and townhouses remain affordable options. Overall, the analysis helps investors and agents understand pricing trends, buyer preferences, and the best times to act in the market.
